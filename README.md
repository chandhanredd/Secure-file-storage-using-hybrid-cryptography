# Secure-file-storage-using-hybrid-cryptography
In the proposed system, a method for securely storing files in the cloud using a hybrid cryptography algorithm is presented. In this system, the user can store the file safely in online cloud storage as these files will be stored in encrypted form in the cloud and only the authorized user has access to their files.
